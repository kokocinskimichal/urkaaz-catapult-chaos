### Changed

- Rebuilt the fortress hitbox as one alpha-bounds rectangle shared by both
  fortress sprites and removed fortress-name labels from the hitbox debug view.
- Pinch zoom now anchors on the gesture focus, supports up to 4x zoom, and
  temporarily takes precedence over automatic camera tracking.
- Soil tiles render at a base width of 256 view units in the Android game and
  web map preview; the Android renderer preserves tile proportions and repeats
  the texture vertically.
- Fortress and unit HP bars share one visual style, with the fortress bar
  constrained to its sprite and reload indicators reduced and moved beside it.
- Fortress world dimensions are now 672x504 units, 20% larger than the doubled
  560x420 size; sprite, collision and protected foundation geometry stay linked.
- Catapult sprites now scale with the fortresses, preserving their relative
  size in both the match screen and map editor.
- On full-size maps, the first garrison slot is now 690 world units from each
  edge (up from 250) and slots use 70-unit spacing (up from 40); compact maps
  clamp the first slot to keep it clear of the midpoint.
- Cropped all blue- and red-facing Raging Boar animation sprites to one shared
  ground-aligned canvas while preserving their visible render size.
